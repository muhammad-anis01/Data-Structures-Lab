Sorting Algorithms Time Comparison (C++)
Overview
This program reads a large list of integers from a file and compares the execution time of Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. The goal is to analyze the performance difference between the two sorting algorithms using the same dataset.

Features
Reads integers from a file (numbers.txt)

Stores data in dynamically allocated arrays

Implements:

Optimized Bubble Sort (early exit if already sorted)
Selection Sort
Measures execution time using chrono

Displays time taken by each sorting algorithm in milliseconds

Input File Format
The input file must be named numbers.txt and should contain integers separated by commas.

Example:

10,45,23,89,12,7,34
How the Program Works
Opens and reads the entire line from numbers.txt
Counts how many numbers are present
Stores the numbers in two separate arrays
Sorts one array using Bubble Sort
Sorts the second array using Selection Sort
Measures and prints the time taken by each algorithm
Sample Output
Bubble Sort: 4 milliseconds
Selection Sort: 13 milliseconds
(Actual time may vary depending on system performance and input size.)

Requirements
C++11 or later
A compiler such as g++
numbers.txt file in the same directory as the program
Notes
Bubble Sort is optimized using a swap-check mechanism
Selection Sort always performs the same number of comparisons
Dynamic memory is properly released to avoid memory leaks
Purpose
This program is designed for academic and learning purposes to demonstrate:

File handling in C++
Sorting algorithms
Time complexity comparison
Performance measurement using modern C++ features
